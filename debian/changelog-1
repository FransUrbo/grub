grub2 (2.02~beta2-21) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre ]
  * Fix overlap check in check_blocklists for load_env (backported patch
    from upstream commit 1f6af2a9; LP: #1311247).

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add support for running a 64-bit Linux kernel on a 32-bit EFI (closes:
    #775202).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use mtmsr rather than mtmsrd in ppc64el-disable-vsx.patch, since the
    "VSX Available" bit is in the lower half of the MSR anyway, and mtmsrd
    faults on 32-bit systems (closes: #776400).

  * Generate alternative init entries in advanced menu (closes: #757298,
    #773173).
  * When configuring grub-pc, copy unicode.pf2 to /boot/grub/ even if
    /boot/grub/grub.cfg does not exist yet; this matches the behaviour of
    grub-efi-* (thanks, Luca Capello; closes: #617196).

  * Handle case insensitivity of VFAT filesystem on /boot/EFI when installing
    extra cpoy of grub-efi to the removable media path
    /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOT$ARCH.EFI (Closes: #773092)
  * Make the force_efi_extra_removable debconf prompt only show up when
    configuring grub-*efi*. Closes: #773004

  [ Ian Campbell ]
  * Improvements to English wording of new debconf template from Justin B Rye.
  * Add debian/README.source.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add support for forcing an extra copy of grub-efi to the removable
    media path /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOT$ARCH.EFI (#767037)

  [ Ian Campbell ]
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

grub2 (2.02~beta2-17) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix up some pointer-to-integer casts in linuxefi so that it can build on
    i386-efi.
  * Backport from upstream:
    - Fix typo (gettext_print instead of gettext_printf) (LP: #1390766).

  [ Ian Campbell ]
  * Correct syntax error in grub-xen-host bootstrap configuration file.
  * Log failure when grub-install fails in postinst, rather than failing the
    entire postinst. (Closes: #770412)
  * Arrange to insmod xzio and lzopio when booting a kernel as a Xen guest.
    (Closes: #755256)

grub2 (2.02~beta2-16) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Ian Campbell ]
  * Provide prebuilt grub-xen binaries for host use in a new grub-xen-host
    package.
  * Build/Install binaries into /boot/xen when installing grub-xen.

grub2 (2.02~beta2-15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Disable nvram installation again on chrp_ibm machines that are emulated
    by qemu; that doesn't have nvram devices so the nvram utility inevitably
    fails.

grub2 (2.02~beta2-14) unstable; urgency=medium

  * On architectures without a real GRUB port, just build the utilities.
    This makes tools such as grub-probe and grub-fstest available
    everywhere, and makes grub-mount available on all Linux and kFreeBSD
    architectures.
  * Remove .MIPS.abiflags section from images (thanks, Jurica Stanojkovic,
    although I used a slightly simpler approach; closes: #762307).
  * Include a text attribute reset in the clear command for ppc
    (LP: #1295255).
  * Disable VSX instruction on powerpc startup to fix booting on ppc64el.
  * Stop adding a CHRP note on chrp_ibm machines, since that apparently
    breaks PowerVM and isn't needed on other machine types as far as we can
    tell (LP: #1334793).
  * Refactor flicker-free-boot configuration in debian/rules to reduce
    duplication.
  * Disable flicker-free-boot on Ubuntu ppc64el for now, as it isn't needed
    there and causes too many problems (LP: #1338471).
  * Use nvram rather than nvsetenv on chrp_ibm machines, since that tool is
    better-supported and copes with such things as nvram being missing in
    qemu.
  * Remove brace-expansion from the postrm, and switch the preinst and
    postrm to /bin/sh (closes: #762940).
  * On ppc64el, look for a PReP partition and install the core image to the
    first one if found.  For now this is done by borrowing prep-bootdev.c
    from grub-installer, incurring a dependency on libparted.

grub2 (2.02~beta2-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop gcc-4.9-multilib build-dependency on ppc64el again.

grub2 (2.02~beta2-12) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Point Vcs-* fields back at master.
  * Support grub-emu on x32 (closes: #760428).
  * Adjust packaging for x32:
    - Build-depend on cpio on x32 as well.
    - Make grub-efi-ia32-bin and grub-efi-amd64-bin depend on efibootmgr on
      any Linux architecture for which they are built (in practice, adding
      x32).
    - Build grub-mount-udeb on x32 as well.
    - Add Lintian binary-from-other-architecture overrides where
      appropriate.
  * Apply patches from Paulo Flabiano Smorigo to allow building a 32-bit
    big-endian loader on ppc64el using -m32 -mbig-endian, replacing the
    cross-compiler hack.

  [ Ian Campbell ]
  * Add dependency on efibootmgr to grub-efi-{arm,arm64}-bin.

grub2 (2.02~beta2-11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Force grub-pc/mixed_legacy_and_grub2 to be reshown, rather than failing
    when it was already seen (closes: #749571).
  * Build with GCC 4.9 (closes: #748003).
  * Build for sparc64 (closes: #753784).
  * Fix an infinite loop in grub-mkconfig when kernel paths contain regex
    metacharacters.  Thanks to Heimo Stranner for the report.
  * On upgrade, if we find that one of the install devices no longer exists,
    ask the debconf question at priority critical rather than high.

grub2 (2.02~beta2-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add the true module to the signed image, since 05_debian_theme uses it.
    Thanks to Dimitri John Ledkov for the report.
  * Limit test suite parallelisation to 1; the test suite seems to have some
    isolation problems at higher levels at the moment (closes: #746856).
  * Simplify override_dh_install a bit.
  * Backport patches from upstream to make the network stack more responsive
    on busy networks (LP: #1314134).

  [ Dimitri John Ledkov ]
  * Add support for nvme device in grub-mkdevicemap (closes: #746396,
    LP: #1275162).

  [ Debconf translations ]
  * Korean (Changwoo Ryu, closes: #745559).
